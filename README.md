# TypeScript/jQuery Starter App

This starter app was derived from the output of [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), but then trimmed down and modified for creating
small projects with minimal dependencies.

The purpose of this starter app is to provide a few of the benefits of working on an Angular app while
creating a small project, namely:
 - TypeScript support.
 - Building with webpack.
 - Testing with webpack-dev-server, having code automatically recompiled and your app relaunched
 everytime you make code changes.
 - Built-in support for unit testing with Karma.
 - Built-in support for end-to-end testing with Protractor.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` to inspect your code with [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Unit tests rely on using the Chrome web browser. Run `npm run test` to execute your unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

End-to-end tests rely on using the Chrome web browser. Run `npm run e2e` to execute your end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
